## Project Overview

Forecasting stock prices is vital for investors and financial analysts. In this project, we apply statistical and machine learning regression models to predict the monthly closing prices of Yes Bank. The goal is to evaluate multiple approaches and highlight the most effective techniques for financial time-series forecasting.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization of Yes Bank's historical stock prices.
- Implementation and comparison of various regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - ARIMA/SARIMA (if applicable)
  - Other relevant time-series forecasting models
- Model evaluation using appropriate performance metrics.
- Visualization of predictions vs actual prices.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of historical monthly closing prices of Yes Bank stocks. You can obtain the data from Yahoo Finance or other reliable financial data sources. Ensure the data includes at least the following columns:

- `Date`
- `Close` (Monthly closing price)

You may need to preprocess the data to aggregate daily prices into monthly closing prices.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**  
   Collect stock price data, handle missing values, and perform necessary transformations.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Visualize trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the data.

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Implement and tune various regression and time-series models.
   - Compare results to determine the most accurate forecasting method.

4. **Evaluation:**  
   Use metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, etc. to assess model performance.

5. **Visualization:**  
   Plot actual vs predicted values for visual comparison.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salman-mugloo/Yes-Bank-Stock-closing-price-prediction-.git
   cd Yes-Bank-Stock-closing-price-prediction-
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python libraries (preferably in a virtual environment):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Typical requirements include:
   - pandas
   - numpy

## Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open and Run Notebooks:**
   - Go through the provided Jupyter notebooks step by step.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook markdown cells for guidance on data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

3. **Modify and Experiment:**
   - Replace the dataset with updated data or try different regression models.

## Results

- The performance of each model is compared and visualized in the notebooks.
- Key findings, charts, and performance metrics are included for each approach.
- The best performing model(s) for predicting Yes Bank's monthly closing prices are highlighted.
